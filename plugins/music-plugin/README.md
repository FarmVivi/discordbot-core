### Extending Commands

Commands follow Fluxcord's command pattern:

```java
commandService.registerCommand(plugin, builder -> {
    builder.name("mycommand")
           .description("My command description")
           .executor((ctx, cmd) -> {
               // Command logic
               return CommandResult.SUCCESS;
           });
});
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- The plugin uses efficient audio buffering to minimize latency
- Queue operations are O(1) for most common operations
- Player messages update with throttling to avoid rate limits
- Audio sources are initialized lazily to reduce memory usage

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't join voice channel

- Ensure bot has `Connect` and `Speak` permissions
- Check if voice region is supported

### No sound playing

- Verify volume isn't set to 0
- Check if track is actually supported by the source
- Review logs for loading errors

### Player message not updating

- Ensure bot has `Manage Messages` permission
- Check if channel allows embedded messages
- Verify message hasn't been manually deleted

### High latency/lag

- Reduce buffer sizes in performance settings
- Ensure good connection to Discord voice servers
- Consider enabling native transport
